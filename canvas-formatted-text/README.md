This document groups use cases for new HTML Canvas features and provides high level explainers on the proposals for each area. The use cases are Styled and Accessible Text, and Extended Text Metrics to support Editing and richer text operations.

## <a name="placeELement"></a>HTML-in-Canvas

[APIs for placing html content into a canvas](https://github.com/WICG/canvas-place-element) support rich, interactive HTML content in a canvas context.

## <a name="Editing"></a>Editing, Art and Design

[New Canvas Text Metrics APIs](./text-metrics-additions.md) will support selection and editing of text in canvas, reducing the need for javascript solutions. We also propose
methods for more flexible rendering of complex text strings.
